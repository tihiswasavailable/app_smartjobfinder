# Smart Job Finder

This is a simple Android App based on Java. Smart Job Finder is a job search app that allows you 
to browse through job listings in europe and apply for them.

This app is intended to be used by people who are looking for a entry level job in the IT sector.

Due to the fact that this app is still in development, and Java is not fully supported by Android anymore, it is not yet available on the Google Play Store.

## Features

Applying for jobs was not easier. Just browse through the job listings and click on the one you like.

After that you will be redirected to the company's details page where you can apply for the job.

If you are not sure if you want to apply for a job, you can save it to your favorites and apply for it later.
